# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

- `InvestmentFunction::compute()` says which Solver of the inner Block
  returned which status when that Solver gives no solution and no proof that
  there is none: the caller reads `kError` and nothing else, so a run that
  stopped there told neither what answered nor what it answered


- the comment of the feasibility cut says why a certificate of infeasibility
  supports no cut against a scaled design, a kappa entering the constraints
  it appears in through their right-hand side alone, with the numbers of the
  instance where it was measured

- the two indices of a unit under investment are named inside the loop and
  not by a structured binding of it, a structured binding being what a lambda
  cannot capture when OpenMP is on

- the walk over what a Block holds asks the Block for its groups of
  Constraint, one run at a time, rather than the vectors of `boost::any` that
  are not there any more: the constant of a cut is summed over them, and a
  combination of linearizations keeps the coefficients of its constituents
  whatever their number

- whoever links the module keeps it: the classes of a module register
  themselves in the factory from a static initialiser, and a linker that
  drops what looks unused takes the registration away with it, so the target
  now tells whoever links it to keep the symbol that forces the module in,
  and on ELF, where naming the symbol is not enough, the library as a whole

### Fixed

- the derivative with respect to the scale factor of a unit takes in the
  rows of the pollutant budget, the storage levels of the unit included

- after a compute that fails, the Function hears again the Modification of
  its inner Block

- the derivative with respect to the scale factor of a unit subtracts its
  fixed consumption when it is off

- the step that fetches the data archive of this module says what went wrong
  when it goes wrong: the download is checked, an archive that did not arrive
  is removed instead of being left on disk for the build to take for the real
  one, and the message names the URL. A server that answers with an error page
  used to leave a file of a few bytes there, which made the next build fail
  while extracting it, with the message of `tar` and no mention of the
  download

- makefile-c takes TwoStageStochasticBlock from its makefile-s, so that the
  core SMS++ objects are not listed twice

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- the inner Block of an InvestmentFunction can be a TwoStageStochasticBlock,
  whose here-and-now Variable then live outside the scenarios in a single
  copy: the investment is written into every leaf of the scenario structure,
  and the linearization is read from every sub-Block that carries it

- the value function has a vertical linearization where the inner Block is
  infeasible, i.e., the feasibility cut of a Benders decomposition, and a
  provably infeasible inner subproblem is reported as kInfeasible rather than
  kError

### Changed

- the linearization in the capacity of a unit is asked to
  `UnitBlock::get_kappa_linearization()`

- the accessor to the inner Block is gone, `get_nested_Blocks()` being it

- the version of the module is the git tag of its repository, or the
  VERSION.txt of a release tarball, and the shared library carries it: its
  SONAME is major.minor while the major is 0, and it is installed with an
  RPATH relative to itself, so that an installed tree keeps working wherever
  it is moved

### Fixed

- the derivative of a flow limit carries the factor the limit is scaled by

- each replica of the inner Block of an InvestmentFunction is un-configured
  with the clone that configured it

- the package configuration file finds the libraries the module links, so that
  a project using the installed module needs nothing more than find_package(),
  StOpt comprised

## [0.1.1] - 2025-12-12

### Added

- added Configuration for output Solution

- integration of test/ with common_utils (although test/
  will have to be removed)

- InvestmentBlockSolution and its handling

### Changed

- adapted to new standard organization of makefiles

### Fixed

- properly translated investment variable values in
  InvestmentBlockSolution when f\_reformulate\_bounds
  == true

## [0.1.0] - 2024-02-29

### Added

- First test release
